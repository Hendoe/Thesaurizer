Thesaurizer is going to be an automated Thesaurus. It comes preloaded with commonly used adjectives, finds them in text inputs given by the user, than offers suggestions for words to change them out with, as well as providing several metrics about a given text input.

At the moment, the JavaScript only includes a few functions for combing through a block of text. I need to build out a few arrays link them to each other. Mainly an array with all the words that Thesaurizer will seek out. Numerous arrays of Synonyms will be tied to the main array.

There are so many ways to play around with the English Language. The purposes of this app are to get me thinking in broader terms for writing assignments in college, boost my overall vocabulary by introducing my mind to a more diverse vernacular, and be a fun way to test out my coding abilities with arrays, functions, and built in JS methods.

It's in a very early stage right now. A final working version will not be at all complicated visually; probably just a basic form to paste text into, a checkbox of words to seek or not to seek, and a little button to activate the application.
